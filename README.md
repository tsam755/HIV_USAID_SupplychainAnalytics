# USAID HIV/AIDS Shipment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the efforts of USAID's HIV/AIDS shipments from 2006 to 2015 to the African countries in supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, which aim to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat.

Using shipment data from USAID and complementary global datasets, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patterns and risk clusters that can inform future program decisions.

The project is designed for a non-technical audience, particularly policymakers from USAID and African Ministries of Health, and focuses on showcasing the impact of diagnostics and treatment shipments.

Our findings are summarized in a Power BI Dashboard.

## UNAIDS 90-90-90 Goals
The UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets are:
- **90% Diagnosed:** 90% of people living with HIV know their HIV status.
- **90% on Treatment:** 90% of diagnosed individuals receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART).
- **90% Virally Suppressed:** 90% of people on ART achieve viral suppression (undetectable virus levels).

---

## Datasets Used
- **Primary Dataset:**
  - USAID Supply Chain Shipment Pricing Dataset (2006–2015)
 
- **Complementary Datasets:**
  - HIV/AIDS Deaths, Prevalence, and Incidence
  - Antiretroviral (ARV) Therapy Coverage
  - Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) - Infrastructure & Business Impact of HIV/AIDS

---

## Key Metrics for Alignment
- **Testing Access:** Number of HIV Rapid Diagnostic Tests shipped to support the first 90.
- **Treatment Access:** Volume of ARVs shipped to support the second 90.
- **Outcome Measurement:** Viral suppression rates (where available) and trends in new HIV infections and deaths.

---

## Key Techniques
- Data Integration across multiple sources (in PowerBI).
- **Unsupervised Machine Learning:**
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction for better visualization of country performance profiles.
- **Power BI Dashboard** for visualization and storytelling.

## Key Insights
- **Strong Alginment with UNAIDS 90-90-90 Goals**
  - USAID’s shipments of HIV Rapid Diagnostic Test (HRDT) kits and Antiretroviral (ARV) treatments significantly supported progress toward the first two 90 targets: increasing HIV testing coverage and expanding access to treatment. As a result, several countries reported declines in both new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths.
  - Additional country-level health outcome data would be needed to fully evaluate the third 90% (viral suppression).

- PCA analysis revealed distinct groups of countries requiring targeted supply chain and infrastructure interventions.
